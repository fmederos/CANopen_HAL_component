LinuxCNC HAL component for CANopen communications using CANFestival
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Check canopen.hal to see load parameters of the component.
Load parameters are intended to:
-Map input and output pins of the component to certain objects of
the remote-device object dictionary
-Assign an ID to this device (master)
-Choose remote device ID to communicate 
-Establish a repetition rate for CANopen sync-frames (network protocol may
have other sync-frame rep.rate, like RTnet does)
-Select a number of CANopen sync-frames that slave and master should wait
between consecutive transmissions (this number need not be the same for
slave and master).

When the component is loaded tries to configure the slave device
to periodically transmit frames containing the values of slave's objects passed
with the 'output=' parameter list, these values will be put on the component's
output pins.
It also starts to periodically send values of the input pins to the slave's
objects which have been passed with the 'input=' parameter list.
